Given that this market simulation is driven by randomized agents who post bids and asks stochastically around the current price, the underlying volatility evolution is not driven by strategic behavior but by aggregated random order flow. This kind of behavior aligns with real-world markets, in the sense that a large portion of trading activity is driven by liquidity needs, noise traders, or partially random behavioral responses, meaning that aggregate volatility dynamics can at times resemble those generated by stochastic, non-strategic agents.

Based on the ranking, Linear Regression and XGBoost achieved comparable top performance, with Linear Regression slightly outperforming XGBoost but not in an statistically significant manner. The fact that a simple linear model performs as well as a nonlinear ensemble like XGBoost suggests that the volatility process generated by these random agents behaves approximately as a linear stochastic process under the carefully engineered feature representation. Any nonlinear structure that emerges from the random microstructure appears too weak or too noisy to provide consistent predictive gains.

Decision Trees performed worse and showed higher variance, showing instability that is typical of single-tree models. GARCH, ARIMA, ARMA, and AR(1) ranked lowest with higher mean errors and substantially larger standard deviations. This reflects the limited temporal persistence in the volatility process generated by these randomized agents. Although the system appears to be largely linear with respect to the engineered features, it does not have strong autoregressive memory. As a result, models that impose a strict autoregressive structure on volatility struggle, whereas direct regression-based approaches better capture the weakly dependent but approximately linear relationship between the features and realized volatility.

The Persistent model is a baseline forecasting past hour volatility as next-hour volatility, which ranks the lowest, showing a lack of strong autocorrelation in the volatitliy of randomized agents, yet it is still predictable by ML models.

For log return prediction, ARMA, AR(1), and XGBoost, achieve the lowest mean MAE with similarly low standard deviations, placing them at the top rank. This suggests that in a randomized agent market, log return itself exhibits stronger short-term temporal dependence as opposed to volatility. XGBoost also performs nearly identical to ARMA, indicating that even though the underlying log return dynamics are stochastic, they are largely linear in the short-horizon evolution.

In contrast, Linear Regression and Decision Tree exhibit higher mean errors and weaker dominance overall. Linear Regression, in particular, shows extremely high variability across folds, indicating instability in this feature representation for log return forecasting. GARCH and ARIMA outperform only the naïve persistence baseline, suggesting that imposing a conditional variance structure or additional integration does not materially improve short-horizon log return prediction. The Persistent model is a baseline forecasting past hour log return as next-hour log return, which ranks the lowest, showing a lack of strong, first-order correlation in the log returns in a market of randomized agents.

Overall, these results indicate that even in a purely stochastic market environment, log returns retain modest but exploitable short-term memory. The evolution of returns appears predominantly linear and sequential, implying that models explicitly designed to capture dependence across recent time steps are naturally better suited for short-horizon prediction.
